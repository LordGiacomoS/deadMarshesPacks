You shall not pass!
Such is the nature of evil...
Muster the Rohirrim!
Forth Eorlingas!
Now for wrath, now for ruin and the red dawn!
Fell deeds awake...
Fool of a took!
True courage is about knowing not when to take a life, but when to spare one.
The battle for Middle Earth is about to begin...
Nobody tosses a dwarf!
All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.
Courage is the best defence that you have now.
The road goes ever on and on...
My precious!
Do not come between the Nazg√ªl and his prey!
Not all tears are an evil.
One ring the rule them all...
You have my sword...
..and you have my bow...
..and my axe!
Minas Tirith, the City of Kings.
