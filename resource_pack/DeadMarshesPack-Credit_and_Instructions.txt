== INTRO ==
> This resource pack is an amalgamation of EpicQuestz's main resource pack, EpicQuestz's Eriador add-on, and a few additional textures created specifically for EQ's Dead Marshes map
> Latest Minecraft version compatible: MC v1.20.6

== CREDIT AND ATTRIBUTION ==
> Some of these textures are based off those from the texture pack "Jolicraft".
> These can be found under: http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/163244-16x-jolicraft-16-horses-horses-horses/
> We have also used some (altered) textures from the Minecraft Middle-Earth packs, find them on http://www.mcmiddleearth.com/. These have been used with full permission from MCME as of 2011.

== OTHER ==
> Although this pack has the same route, the EpicQuestz pack is *no longer* the same as our sister server (Empire War)'s pack. See www.empirewar.org.
